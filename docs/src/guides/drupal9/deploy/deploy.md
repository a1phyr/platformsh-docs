## Deployment

If you have been customizing your existing project as you go, now is the time to ensure all code is committed to Git and to `git push` to Platform.sh on the `master` branch.  That will cause Platform.sh to build your code, producing a read-only file system image of your application, and then deploy it into a running cluster of containers.

You can view the process from the Management Console; when it is done, click the URL shown in the Console to see your site.

## Post-install

If relevant.
